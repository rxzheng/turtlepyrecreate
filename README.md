Hello Ms. Desouza,
This is the code for my poster.

In order to run this code, please do this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rxzheng/turtlepyrecreate
```

```bash
nano recreate.py
```
Change the path that the script searches for to the image that you would like to use.

Change the text inside Image.open() to point towards your path.
```python
# REPLACE IMGPATH WITH THE IMAGE'S PATH
img = Image.open('/Users/richardzheng/Documents/GitHub/turtlepyrecreate/hangingRockImage.jpg')
```
